# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part B)

## Requirements
1. Comment on the quality of your sample. Do you expect it to be representative of your target population? Why or why not?

    ```
   Relevance: Yes. The survey focuses on lower-level employees who have stayed with the company for a while and have experienced the company culture.
Accuracy: Moderate. The group excludes employees who left within probation and those who have already left the company.
Timeliness: Yes. The group is most likely to quit due to high turnover at this time.
Accessibility: Yes. The group is still working in the office and is reachable.
Completeness/coherence: yes, the group will be just in the company.
I still expect the sample to be representative. They have experienced the company culture and are likely debating whether to stay, providing valuable insights on the pros and cons of remaining.
    ```

2. Given the class content (error, survey quality, ethics) covered since Part A of the assignment, do you wish to make any changes to your original survey? If so, make a copy of your original survey and make any desired changes. Describe the changes and your reasoning. Provide a link here for submission.

    ```
    
1.Do you foresee yourself still with this company in five years?
Modified:How long have you been in the company? Do you foresee yourself still with this company in five years? Why or why not?
Reason: Added an easy-to-answer introductory question followed by an open-ended one to gather more detailed insights about future plans.

2. How long do you think you will be promoted to a higher position?
Modified:How satisfied are you with the opportunities for career advancement?
Reason: Rephrased to address career advancement opportunities broadly, not just promotions, to encompass role changes and duty switches.

3.What do you think are the perks to work for our company?
Modified:In the past few months, what do you think are the perks of working for our company?
Reason: Encourages respondents to recall and articulate specific perks, providing richer qualitative data.

4.Do you think your work is valuable to your coworkers or the management team?
Modified:To what extent do you feel your work is valued by your coworkers or management on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being the lowest?
Reason: Makes the question more quantifiable and analyzable, allowing for detailed data analysis.

5.How do you think our pay is competitive in the job market?
Modified:How do you think your pay is competitive in the job market? on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being the lowest?
Reason: Changed from "our rate" to "your rate" to make it more personal and relevant to the respondent's perspective.Also ask the question analyzable

6.Do you feel your work sometimes burns you out?
Modified: Have you experienced burnout? If yes, what might be the reasons?
Reason: Made it an open-ended question to elicit more detailed responses about potential factors contributing to burnout.

7.How much have you learned and grown professionally since joining the company?
Modified:What factors influenced your decision to stay or consider leaving the company?
Reason: Replaced this question, as we are looking for the reason why people decide to leave the company. We are looking for something more related to identifying company issues
    ```

3. Could the purpose of your survey have been fulfilled through an observational study? If yes, how? If no, why not?

    ```
    I don't think so. My survey meant to understand the reasons behind high turnover among junior positions.
By observing employee behavior, we can gather data on vacation and sick leave requests,the turn over rate, employee complaints/feedbacks.We might be able to identify the department or function from the trends or pattern analysed. But the underlying reasons cause those behaviors are hard to figure out.
Therefore, based on my questionnaire, most of my questions are to capture subjective feelings and personal experiences, such as job satisfaction, personal perceptions, intentions.
    ```
